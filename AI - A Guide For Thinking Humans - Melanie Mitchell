**Generic Art**
- 'generic art' by computer scientist and artist Karl Sims is a computer generated digital artwok
- Sims programmed computers to generate digital artworks using an algorithm loosly inspired by Darwinian natural selection
Using mathematical functions with some random elements, SIm's program would generate sveral different candidate artworks
- A person would select the one he or she liked the best
-The program wouls create variations of the selected artwork by introducing randomness into the underlying mathematical fuctions
-The person would then select a favourite of the mutations, and so on, for many interations
-This process generated some stunning abstract works that have been exhibited widely in museum shows
