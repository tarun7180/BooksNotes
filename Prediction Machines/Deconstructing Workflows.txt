- The actual implementation of AI is through the development of tools
- The unit of AI tool design is not "the job" or "the occupation" or "teh strategy", but rather "the task".
- Tasks are collections of decisions
- Decisions are based on prediction and judgement and informed by data.The decisions within a taskk often shafe thease elements in common. Where they differ is in the action that follows
- Sometimes we can automate all the decisions within a taskk
- Or we can now automate the last remaining decision that has not yet been automated becuase of enhanced prediction
- The rise of prediciton machines motivates thinking about how to redesign and automate entire processes, or what we term here "workkflows", effectively removing humans from such tasks altogether.
- But for better and cheaper prediction alone ot lead to pure automation, employing prediction machines must also increase the returns to using machines in other aspects of a task
- Otherwise, you will want to employ a prediction machine to workk with human decision makers
- AI tools can change workflows in 2 ways. First, they can render tasks obsolete and therefore remove them from workkflows. Second, they can add new tasks. This may be different for every business and workflow
- AI tools are point solutions
- Each generates a specific prediction, and most are designe to perform a specific task
- Many AI startups are predicated on building a single AI tool
- Large corporations are comprised of workflows that turns inputs into outputs
- Workkflows are made up of tasks
- In decising how to implement AI, companies will break their workkflows down into tasks, rank-order the AIs in terms of ROI, and then start from the top of the list and begin working downward
- Sometimes a ccompany can simply drop an AI tool into itd workflow and realize an immediate benefit due to increaing the productivity of that taskk
- Deriving a real benefit from implementing an AI toll requires rethinking, or "reengineering" the entire workflow. As a result, similar to the personal computer revolution, it will take time to see productivity gain from AI in many mainstream businesses
- To illustrate the potential effect of an AI on a workflow, we describe a fictitious AI that predicts the ranking of any MBA application. To derive the full benefit from this prediction machine, the school would have to redesign its workflow. It would need to eliminate the task of manually ranking applications and expand the task of marketing the program, as the AI would increase the returns to a greater applicant pool (better predictions about who will succedd and lower cost of evaluating applications). The school would modify the task of offering incentives like scholarships and financial aid due to increased certianity about who will succeed. Finally, the schoo would adjust other elements of the workflow to take advantage of being able to provide instantaneous school admission decisions.
