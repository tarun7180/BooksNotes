- The actual implementation of AI is through the development of tools
- The unit of AI tool design is not "the job" or "the occupation" or "teh strategy", but rather "the task".
- Tasks are collections of decisions
- Decisions are based on prediction and judgement and informed by data.The decisions within a taskk often shafe thease elements in common. Where they differ is in the action that follows
- Sometimes we can automate all the decisions within a taskk
- Or we can now automate the last remaining decision that has not yet been automated becuase of enhanced prediction
- The rise of prediciton machines motivates thinking about how to redesign and automate entire processes, or what we term here "workkflows", effectively removing humans from such tasks altogether.
- But for better and cheaper prediction alone ot lead to pure automation, employing prediction machines must also increase the returns to using machines in other aspects of a task
- Otherwise, you will want to employ a prediction machine to workk with human decision makers
- AI tools can change workflows in 2 ways. First, they can render tasks obsolete and therefore remove them from workkflows. Second, they can add new tasks. This may be different for every business and workflow
