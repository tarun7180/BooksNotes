- Our process for implementing AI tools will determine which outcome you should emphasize
- It involves evaluating entire workflows, whether are within or across jobs (or departmental or organizational boundaries), and then breaking down the workflow into constituent tasks and seeing whether you can fruitfully employ a prediction machine in those tasks. Then you must reconstitute tasks into jobs
- In some cases, the goal is to fully automate every task associated with a job
- AI tolls are unlikely to be a catalyst for this on their own because workflows amenable to full automation have a series of tasks involved that cannot be easily avoided, even for tasks that seem initially to be both skilled and unimportant
- Prediction machines will reduce uncertainity, but they won't always eliminate it
- Some jobs may continue to exist but require new skills.
- Automating a particular task can empasize other tasks that are important to a job but were previously underappreciated
- Automation that eliminates a human from a task does not necessarily eliminate them from a job
- A job is acollectio of tasks
- When breaking down a workflow and employing AI tools, some tasks previously performed by humans may be automated, the ordering and emphasis of remaining tasks may change, and new tasks may be created.
- Thus, the collection of tasks that make up a job can change
- The implementation of AI tools generates four implications for jobs:
1) AI tools may augment jobs, as in the example of spreadsheets and bookkeepers
2) AI tools may contract jobs, as in fulfillment centres
3) AI tools may lead to the reconstitution of the jobs, with some tasks added and others taken away, as with radiologists
4) AI tools may shift the emphasis on the specific skills required for a particular job, as with school bus drivers
