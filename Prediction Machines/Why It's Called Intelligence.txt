- Better data, and computers are at the core of the progress in prediction
- To understand their value, let's consoder a long standing problem or prediction: forecasting what marketers call "customer churn"
- The first step in reducing churn is to identify at-risk customers. Companies can use prediction technologies to do that
- Historically, the core method for predicting churn was a statistical technique called "regression"
- What does regression do? It finds a prediction based on the average of whathas occurred in the past
- Much of what we know about prediction has been making our calculatins of the average better by building models that can take in more data about the context. We have done this by using something called "the conditional average"
- Before machine learning, multivariate regression provided an efficient way to condition on multiple things, without he need to calculate dozens, hundreds, or thousands of conditional averages
- Regression take the data and tries to find the rsult that minimizes prediction milstakes, maximizing what is called "goodness of fit"
- Regression minimizes prediction mistakes on average and ounishes large errors more than small ones. It is a powerful method, espicially with relatively small data sets and a good sense of what will be useful in prediction
- In addition, regression models aspire to generate unbiased results, so with enough preictions, thes epredictions will be exactly correct on average
- Unlike regression, machine learning predictions might be wrong on average, but when the prediction miss, they often don't miss by much. Statistician describe this as allowing some bias in exchange for reducing variance
- An importane difference between machine learning and regression analysis is te way in which new techniques are developed
- Inventing a new machine learning method involves proving that it works better in practice. In contrast, inventing a new regression method requires first proving it works in theory
- The focus on working in practice gave machine learning innovators more room to experiment, even if their methods generated estimates that were incorrect on average, or biased
- Improvements in machine learning methods, generally, and deep learning, in particular, mean that it is possible to efficiently turn available data into accurate predictions of churn. and machine learning methods now clearly dominate regression and various other techniques
- The financial crisis of 2008 was a spectecular failure of regression based prediction methods
- The failure was not due to insufficient data, but instead how analysts used that data to form a prediction.
- Ratings agencies based their prediction on multiple regression - like models that assumed house prices in different markets were not correlated with one another
- Analystes buile their regression models on hypothesis of what they believed mattered and how - beliefs unnecessary for machine learning
- Machine learning models are particularly good at determining which of many possible variables will work best and recognizing that some things don't matter and others, perhaps surprisingly, do.
- Now, an analyst's intuition and hypotheses are less important
- In this way, machine learning enables predictions based on unanticipated correlations
- It is tempting to consider the most recent developments in AI and machine learning as just " traditional statistics on steroids"
- In one sense that is true, since the ultimate goal is to generate a prediction to fill i missing information
- Moreover, the process of machine learning involves searching for a solution that tends to minimize errors
- Effective prediction changes the way computers are programmed
- Neither traditional statistical methods nor algorithms of if-then statements operate well in complex environments
- A key technology underpinning recent advances, labeled "deep learning", relies on an approach called "back propogation".
- It avoids all this in a way similar to how natural brains do, by learning through example(whether artificial neurons mimic real ones is an interesting distraction from the usefulness of the technology)
- Many problems have transformed from algorithmic problems to predict problems
- Machine learning uses probabilistic models to solve problems
- Because the output of machine learning - prediction - is a key component of intelligence, the prediction accuracy improves by learning, and the high prediction accuracy often enables machines to perform tasks that, until now, were associated with human intelligence, such as object identification
- In his book On Intelligence, Jeff Hawkins was among the first to argue that prediction is the basis for human intelligence.
- The essence of his theory is that huma intelligence, which is at the core of creativity and productivity gains, is due to the way our brains use memories to make predictions
- Hawkins argues that our brains are constantly making predictions regarding what we are about to experience - what we will see, feel, and hear
- Irrespective of whether the underlying model is appropriate, his emphasis on prediction as the basis for intelligence is useful for understanding the impact of recent changes in AI
- In various ways, prediction machines can use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve the kinds of problems now reserved for humans and improve themselves
-Philospher Ian Hacking, in his book The Taming Of Chance, said that, before the nineteenth century, the rise of government census data applied the newly emerging mathematicsof probability to the social sciences
- The twentieth century saw the fundamental reordering of our understanding of the physical world, moving from a Netonian deterministic perspective to the uncertainities of quantum mechanics
- Perhaps the most important advance of 21st century computer science matches these previous advances in social and physical sciences: the recognition that algorithm works best when structured probabilistically, based on data
