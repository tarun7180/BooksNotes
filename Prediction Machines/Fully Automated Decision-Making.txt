- Carmakesrs in the Unites States have reached an agreement with the Department of Transportation to make automatic emergency braking standard on vehicles by 2023
- Often, the distinction between AI and automation is muddy
- Automation arises when a machine undertakes and entire task, not just prediction
- AI, in its current incarnation, involves a machine performing one element: prediction
- Each of other elements represents a complement to prediction, something that becomes more valuable as predictions gets cheaper
- Whether full automation makes sense depends on the relative returns to machines also doing the other elements.
- Humans and machines can accumulate data, whether for inout, training, or feedback, depending on the data type.
- A human must ultimately make a judgement, but the human can codify judgement and program it into a machine in advance of a prediction
- Mininng is the perfect opportunity for full automation precisely becuase it has already removed humans from so many activities. These days, humans perform directed but key fucntions.
- Before the recent advances in AI, everything except prediction could already be automated
- Prediction machines represent the last step in removing humans from many tasks involved.
- Prevously, a human scanned the sorrounding environment and told the equipment precisely what to do.
- Now, AI that takes information from sensors learns how to predict obstacles for clear paths
