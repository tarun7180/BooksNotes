- Prediction is the process of filling in missing information.
- Prediction takes the information you have, often clled "data". and uses it to generate information you don't have
- Prediction is being used for traditional tasks, like inventory management and demand forecasting
- More significantly, because it is becoming cheaper it is being used for problems that were not tradidtionally prediction problems
- Kathryn Hume (currently head of digital investments at Royal Bank of Canada) calls the ability to see a problem and reframe it as a prediction problem "AI Insight" , and, today, engineers all over the world are acquiring it
- Critcally, when an input such as prediction becomes cheap, this can enhance the value of other things.Economist call these "complements"
- Just as a drop in the cost of coffee increases the value of sugar and cream, for autonomous vehicles, a drop in the cost of prediction increases the value of sensors to capture data on the vehicle's surroundings
- When prediction is cheap, tere will be more prediction and more complements to prediction. These two simple economic forces drive the new opportunities that prediction machines create
- At low levels, a prediction machine can relieve humans of predictive tasks ans so save on costs
- As the machinerycranks up, prediction can change and impprove decision making quality
- But at some point, a prediction machine may become so accurate and reliable that it changes how an organization does things
- Some AIs will affect the economics of a business so dramatically that they will no longer be ised to simply enhance productivity in executing against the strategy; they will change the strategy itself.
- Amazon obtained a US patent for "anticipatory shipping" in 2013
- Prediction facilitates decisions by reducing uncertainity, while judgement assigns value.
- In economists parlance, judgement is the skill used to determine a payoff, utility, reward, or profit
- The most significany implication of prediction machines designed to perform a specific task
- Some AIs will have such a profound effect on the economics of a task that they will transform a business or industry
- That's when AI becomes the cornerstone of an organization's strategy
- AIs that have an imoact on strategy shift the attention on AI from product managers and operatiions engineers to the C-suite
- Economics provide clear insights regarding the business imlications of cheaper predictions.
- Prediction machine will be used for traditional prediction tasks (inventory nd demand forecasting) and new problems (like navigation and translation).
- The drop in the cost of prediction will impact the value of other things, increasing the value of complements(date, judgement, and action) and diminishing the value of substitutes(humsn prediction)
