- Carmakesrs in the Unites States have reached an agreement with the Department of Transportation to make automatic emergency braking standard on vehicles by 2023
- Often, the distinction between AI and automation is muddy
- Automation arises when a machine undertakes and entire task, not just prediction
- AI, in its current incarnation, involves a machine performing one element: prediction
- Each of other elements represents a complement to prediction, something that becomes more valuable as predictions gets cheaper
- Whether full automation makes sense depends on the relative returns to machines also doing the other elements.
- Humans and machines can accumulate data, whether for inout, training, or feedback, depending on the data type.
- A human must ultimately make a judgement, but the human can codify judgement and program it into a machine in advance of a prediction
- Mininng is the perfect opportunity for full automation precisely becuase it has already removed humans from so many activities. These days, humans perform directed but key fucntions.
- Before the recent advances in AI, everything except prediction could already be automated
- Prediction machines represent the last step in removing humans from many tasks involved.
- Prevously, a human scanned the sorrounding environment and told the equipment precisely what to do.
- Now, AI that takes information from sensors learns how to predict obstacles for clear paths
- When you employ a prediction machine, th eprediction made must be communiated to the decision-maker
- But if the prediction leads to an obvious course of action, then the case for leaving human judgement in the loop is diminished
- If a machine can be coded for judgement and handle the consequent action relatively easily, then it makes sense to leave the entire task in the machines's hands
- Automation occurs when the return to machine handling all functions is greater than the returns to including humans in the process
- Automation can also arise when the costs of communication are high
- What distinguishes the "within factory" environment from the "open road' is the possibility of what economista call "externalities' =- costs that are felt by others, rather than the key decision makers.
- The introduction of AI to a task does not necessarily imply full automation of that task. Prediction is only one component
- In many cases, humans are still required to apply judgement and take an action.
- Howerver, sometimes judgeent can be hard coded or, if enough examples are available, machines can learn to predict judgement
- In addition, machines may perform the action.
- When machines perform all elements of the task, then the task is fully automated and humans are completely removed from the loop
- The tasks most likely to be fully automated first are the ones for which full automation delivers the highest resturns
- These include tasks where: (1) the other elements are already automated except for prediction (e.g. mining); (2) the returns to speed of action in response to prediction are high (e.g., driverless cars); and (3) the returns to reduced waiting time for predictions are high(e.g., space exploration)
