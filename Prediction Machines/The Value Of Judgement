- Having bettr prediction raisis the value of judgement
- Prediction machines don't provide judgement
- Only human do, becuae only humans can express the relative rewards from taking different actions
- As AI takes over prediction, humans will do less of the combined prediction-judgement routine of decision-making and focus more on the judgement role alone
- With better prediction come more opportunities to consoder the rewards of vsrious actions - in other words, more opportunities for judgement
- The promise of AI is that it can make prediction much more precise, especially in situations with a mix of generic and personalized information
- People who have studied decision in the past have generally taken rewards as givens - they simply exist
- Prediction machines increase the returns to judgment because, by lowering the cost of predcition, they increase the value of understanding the rewards associated with actions. Howerver judgement is costly
- Figuring out the relative payoffs for different actions in different situations take time, effort and experimentation
- Many decisions occur under conditions of uncertainity.
- We decide to bring an umbrella because we think it might rain, but we could be wrong
- We decide to authorize a transaction because we think it is legitimate, but we could be wrong
- Under conditions of uncertainity, we need to determine the payoff for acting on wrong decisions, not just right ones.
- So, uncertainity increases the cost of judging the payoffs for a given decision
