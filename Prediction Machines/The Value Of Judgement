- Prediction machines don't provide judgement
- Only human do, becuae only humans can express the relative rewards from taking different actions
- As AI takes over prediction, humans will do less of the combined prediction-judgement routine of decision-making and focus more on the judgement role alone
- With better prediction come more opportunities to consoder the rewards of vsrious actions - in other words, more opportunities for judgement
- The promise of AI is that it can make prediction much more precise, especially in situations with a mix of generic and personalized information
