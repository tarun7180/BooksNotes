- It is useful to seperate the parts of a decision into each of its elements: prediction, input, judgement, training, action, outcome, and feedback
- In the process, we developed an "AI canvas" to help decompose tasks in the order to understand the potential role of a prediction machine
- The canvas is an aid for contemplating, building, and assessing AI tools
- It provides discipline in identifying each component of a taskk's decision
- It forces clarity in describing each component
