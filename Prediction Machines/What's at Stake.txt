- Stakes are the expected losses that arise when there is an error in prediction
- Predictions fail be degrees and in different directions
- We could conclude that when the stakes are higher, AI has to give better prediction so that errors don't appear
- One implication is that when the stakes are high, utilizing AI prediction involves complementary investments in measure that manage the additional risks that are created
- That management will involve either some form of insurance - countering potentially adverse downside outcomes - or some form of protection, reducing the likelihood of those outcomes and containing the adverse consequences
- In many cases, by adopting AI predictio, the hope is ypu can introduce products
- Having greater product variety means you can find consumers who are most likely to find personal value from what you are offering
- Indeed taken to the extreme, AI prediction has offered the hope for complete product personalization: that is, you can supply as many products as there are people
- Loss functions are not just a measure of how accurate a prediction is relative to the stakes but also the consequences of following that prediction with the action you take
- The relevant stakes to use come from judgement, which, as we have already noted, is determined wholly by humans
- While judgement tells you what the value of different possibilites is overall, stakes focus on one particular aspect of that judgment - the relative consequences of errors.Thus, in deploying AI, you want judgment to come from the right person
- While we have framed the choice as to whether to adopt AI prediction or not in terms of the level of stakes, the choice about whether to fully automate a decision or not on hte basis of AI prediction relies on how measurable stakes can be
- No prediction - AI or otherwise-is perfect. Sometimes there are errors.
- Furtehermore, there are different types of errors. For example, a simple binary predictions has two types of errors" false positives and false negatives.
- Different error types may incur different costs, depending on the decision they inform.
- So, when determining hoe to best use predictions is decision-making, businesses must consider the costs of different types of errors
