- The recent developments in AI and machine learning have convinced us that this innovation is on par with the great, transformative technologies of the past: electricity, cars, plastics, the microchip, the internet, and the smartphone
- From economic history, we know how these general-purpose technologies diffuse and transform
- We also realize how hard it is to forecast when, where, and how the most disruptive changes take place
- At the same time, we have learned, what to look for, how to be ahead of the curve, and when a new technology is likely to transition from something intersting to something transformative
- While ROI calculations can influence operational changes, strategic decisions pose dillimas and force leaders to grapple with uncertainity
- Adopting AI is one part of the organization ,ight require changes in another part
- For interorganizational effects, adoption and other decisions require the authority of someone who oversees the entire bisuness, namely, the CEO
- Physial stores cannot forecast individual customer demand, but they can forecast the likely demand from a group of customers
- Moving to a shipping-then-shopping model based on individual homes requires more information about individual cutomer demand, which can overcome the competitive advantange physical stores have
- Companies require a prediction machine that can reduce uncertainity enough to change the balance in the strategic dillema
- How do you reduce the time to deliver products to consumers? Anticipate what they are likely to order nad have it in stock at a distribution centre nearby
- But such inventory management is itself costly
- C-suite leadership must not fully delegate AI strategy to their IT department becasue AI tools may go beyond enhancing the productivity of tasks performed in the service of executing against the organization's strategy and instead lead to changing the strategy itself.
- AI can lead to strategic change if 3 factors are present-
1) there is acore trade-off in the business model
2) the trade-off is influenced by uncertainity 
3) an AI tool that reduces uncertainity tips the scales of the trade-off so that the optimal strategy changes from one side of the trade to the other
