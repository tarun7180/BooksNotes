- The recent developments in AI and machine learning have convinced us that this innovation is on par with the great, transformative technologies of the past: electricity, cars, plastics, the microchip, the internet, and the smartphone
- From economic history, we know how these general-purpose technologies diffuse and transform
- We also realize how hard it is to forecast when, where, and how the most disruptive changes take place
