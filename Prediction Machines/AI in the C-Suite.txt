- The recent developments in AI and machine learning have convinced us that this innovation is on par with the great, transformative technologies of the past: electricity, cars, plastics, the microchip, the internet, and the smartphone
- From economic history, we know how these general-purpose technologies diffuse and transform
- We also realize how hard it is to forecast when, where, and how the most disruptive changes take place
- At the same time, we have learned, what to look for, how to be ahead of the curve, and when a new technology is likely to transition from something intersting to something transformative
- While ROI calculations can influence operational changes, strategic decisions pose dillimas and force leaders to grapple with uncertainity
- Adopting AI is one part of the organization ,ight require changes in another part
- For interorganizational effects, adoption and other decisions require the authority of someone who oversees the entire bisuness, namely, the CEO
- Physial stores cannot forecast individual customer demand, but they can forecast the likely demand from a group of customers
- Moving to a shipping-then-shopping model based on individual homes requires more information about individual cutomer demand, which can overcome the competitive advantange physical stores have
- Companies require a prediction machine that can reduce uncertainity enough to change the balance in the strategic dillema
- How do you reduce the time to deliver products to consumers? Anticipate what they are likely to order nad have it in stock at a distribution centre nearby
- But such inventory management is itself costly
- C-suite leadership must not fully delegate AI strategy to their IT department becasue AI tools may go beyond enhancing the productivity of tasks performed in the service of executing against the organization's strategy and instead lead to changing the strategy itself.
- AI can lead to strategic change if 3 factors are present-
1) there is acore trade-off in the business model
2) the trade-off is influenced by uncertainity 
3) an AI tool that reduces uncertainity tips the scales of the trade-off so that the optimal strategy changes from one side of the trade to the other
- Another reason C-suite leadership is required for AI strategy is that the implementation of AI tools in one part of the business may aslo effect the other parts
- In the Amazon thought experiment, a side effect transitioning to ship-tehn-shop model was integration into the returned items collection business, perhaps with the fleet of trucks that did weekly pickups throughout the nighbourhood. In other words, powerful AI tools may result in significant redesign of workflows and the boundary of the firm
- Prediction machines will increase the value of complements, including judgement, actions, and data
- The increasing value judgement may lead to changes in organizational hierarchy - there may be higher returns to putting different roles or different people in positions of power.
- In addition, prediction machines enable managers to move beyond optimizing individual components to optimizing individual components to optimizing higher-level goals and thus make decisions closer to the optimizing higher-level goals and thus make decisions closer to the objectived of the organization.
- Owning the actions effected by prediction can be a source of competetive advantage that allows traditional businesses to capture some of the value from AI.
- However, in some cases, where powerful AI tools provide a significant competitive advantage, new entrants may vertically integrate into owning the action and leverage there AI as a basis for competition
