- Prediction machines rely on data
- More and better data leads to better predictions
- In economic terms, data is a key complement to prediction. It becomes more valuable as prediction becomes cheaper
- With AI, data plays three roles
  1) First is input data, which is fed to the algorithm and used to produce a prediction
  2) Second id training data, which is used to generate the algorithm in the first place. Training data is used to train the AI to become good enought to predict in the wild.
  3) Finally, there is a feedback data, which is used to improve the algorithm's performance with experience
- In some situations, considerable overlap exists, such that the same data playa all three roles
- But data can be costly to acquire. thus, the investment involves a trade-off between the benefit of more data and the cost of acquiring it.
- To make the right data investment decisions, you must understand how prediction machines use data
- Before the recent enthusiasm over AI, there was excitement about big data
- The current generation of AI technology is called "machine learning" for a reason. The machines learns from data
- Acquiring training data can be challenging.
- To predict the same group if items, you need information or outcome of interest as well as information on something that will be useful for predicting that outcome in a new context
- This is particularly challenging when the prediction is about some future event.
- The prediction machine can only be fed information that is known at the time you want to predict
- Many commercial AI applications have this atructure: use a combination of input data and outcome measured to create the prediction machine, and then uses input data form a new situation to predict the outcome of that situation
- If you can obtain data on outcomes, then your prediction machines can learn contnually through feedback
- Data is often costly to acquire, but prediction machines cannot operate without it. They require data to create, operate and improve
- More types, more objects, and more frequency mean higher cost but also potentially higher benefit
- In order to make a good prediction, the machine must have enough individuals in the training data.
- The number of individuals required depends on 2 factors
  - First how reliable the "signal" is relative to the "noise"
  - Second , how accurate the prediction must be to beuseful
- Data scientist have excellent tools for assessing the amount of data required given the expected reliability of the prediction and the need for accuracy
- These tools are called "power calculations" and tell you how many units you need to analyze to generate a useful prediction
- The salient management point is that you must make a trade-off: more accurate predictions require more units to study, and acquiring these additional units can be costly
- More data improves prediciton
- The benefit of additional information may increase or decrease with the existing amount of data
- In economist speak, data may have increasing or decreasing returns to scale
- You get more useful information from the thid observation then the hundredth, and you learn much more from the hundredth pbservation then the millionth
- As you add observations to your training data, it becomes less and less useful to improving your prediction
- Some have argued that more data about unique factors brings disproportionate rewards to the market
- Increasing data brings disproportinate rewards in the market
- Thus, from and economic point of view, in such cases, data may have increasing returns to scale
- Prediction machines utilize three types of data:
  - Training data for training the AI
  - input data for predicting
  - feedback data for improvig the prediction accuracy
- Data collection is costly; it's an investment
- The cost of data collection depends on how much data you need and how intrusive the collection process is
- It is critical to balanc ethe cost of data acquisition with the benefit of enhanced prediction accuracy
- Determining the best approach requires estimating the ROI of each type of data
  - How much will it cost to acquire
  - How valuable will the associated increase in prediction accuracy be
- Statistical and economic reasons shape whether having more data generate more value.
- From a statistical perspective, data has diminishing returns
- Each additional unit of data improves your prediction less than the prior data; the tenth observation improves prediction by more than one thousandth
- In terms of economics, the relationship is ambigous
- Adding more data to a large existing stock of data may be greate than adding it to a small stock - for example, if the additional data allows the perormance of the prediction machine ot cross a threshold for unusable to usable, or from below a regulatory performance threshold to above, or from worse than a competitor to better
- Thus, organizations need to undestand the relationship between adding more data, enhancing prediction accuracy, and increasing value creation
