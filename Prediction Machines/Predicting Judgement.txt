- A fundamental question, at least for humans, is whether AI can turn its predictive powers on human judgement and , in the process, circumvent the need for humans altogether
- Prediction relies on data. That means humans have 2 advantages over machines. We know some things that the machines don't (yet) and, more importantly, we are better at deciding what to do when there isn't much data
- Humans have 3 types of data that machine don't. First human senses are powerful. Second, humans are the ultimate arbiters of our own preferences. Third, privacy concerns restrict the data available to machines.
- Prediction machines may also lack data because some events are rare.
- If a machine cannot observe enough human decisions, it cannot predict the judgement underlying those decisions
- AI cannot predict what a human would do if that human has never faced a similar situation
- In this way, AI cannot predict the strategic direction of a company facing a new technology, such as the internet, bioengineering, or even AI itself.
- Humans are able to make analogies or recognize useful similarities in different contexts
- Machines may learn to predict human judgement. An example is driving. It is impractical for humans to code their judgement about how to handle every possible situation. However, we train autonomous driving systems by showing them many examples and rewarding them for predicting human judgement: What would a human do in this situation?
- There are limits to the ability of machines to predict human judgement. The limits relate to lack of data.
- There is some data that have machines do not, such as individual preferences
- Such data has value, and companies currently pay to access it through discounts on using loyalty cards and free online services like Google and Facebook
