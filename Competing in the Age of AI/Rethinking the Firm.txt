- Economists like Ronald Coase and Oliver Williamson have declared that firms are formed to accomplish tasks that cannot be completed by individuals working through a market structure. We need firms, because coordinating each worker to engage in joint production through markets alone would require prohibitive transaction costs. Instead, firms provide long-term contracts to coordinate tasks without continually incurring the friction of continuous bargaining and negotiation and thus lower the transaction costs needed to create products and services. The value of these “bundles of contracts” is naturally shaped by the range of tasks organized by the firm—by what the firm promises to do and by how the firm actually gets it done.
- The value of a firm is shaped by two concepts. The first is the firm’s business model, defined as the way the firm promises to create and capture value. The second is the firm’s operating model, defined as the way the firm delivers the value to its customers.
- The business model thus encompasses the strategy of the firm: how it seeks to differentiate itself from competitors by providing and monetizing its unique set of goods or services. Meanwhile, the operating model encompasses the systems, processes, and capabilities that enable the delivery of the goods and services to the firm’s customers. The business model defines the theory, and the operating model captures the practice—what the people and resources of the firm actually do every day. And while the business model points to the potential of the firm, in terms of the value it could deliver, the operating model is the actual enabler of firm value and its ultimate constraint.
- A company’s business model is therefore defined by how it creates and captures value from its customers. It’s important to be precise. There are two elements that come together: first, the company must create value for a customer that prompts her to consume the company’s product or service; second, the company must deploy some method to capture some of the value created.
- Value creation, then, concerns the reason customers choose to use a company’s products or services, and the particular problem the company is solving for customers. This is sometimes known as the value proposition or customer promise 
- Value capture is the other side of the coin. Naturally, the value a company captures from a customer should be less than the value it creates for the customer.
- The new breed of digital firms is all about innovation in the business model, experimenting and recombining various aspects of value creation and value capture. In incumbent companies, value creation and capture are usually straightforward and closely intertwined: value is typically created and captured from the same source (the customer) through a simple pricing mechanism. In a fully digitized business, the options are much broader, because value creation and capture can be separated much more easily and often come from different stakeholders; most of Google’s services are free to users, and the company captures value from advertisers across its product portfolio. For the digital firm, underlying all this business model innovation is a very different kind of operating model.
- Operating models deliver the value promised to customers. Whereas the business model creates a goal for value creation and capture, the operating model is the plan to get it done. As such, the operating model is crucial in shaping the actual value of the firm.
- Operating models can be very complex, frequently including the activities of thousands of people, sophisticated technology, important capital investments, and millions of lines of code that make up the operational systems and processes that enable a company to achieve its goals. But the overarching objectives of an operating model are relatively simple. Ultimately, the goal of an operating model is to deliver value at scale, to achieve sufficient scope, and to respond to changes by engaging in sufficient learning
- Scale: Managing scale, simply put, is about designing an operating model to deliver as much value to as many customers as possible at the lowest cost. Classic cases of improving scale involve efficiently increasing production volume or the number of customers served in, say, car production or fast food restaurants.
- Scope: A firm’s scope is defined as the range of activities it performs—for example, the variety of products and services it offers its customers. Some assets and capabilities can help an organization reach economies across diverse kinds of businesses.
- These economies of scope are important, because they enable corporations to establish multiple lines of business, perhaps managing multiple business units or creating a true conglomerate. With efficiencies of scope, firms can create and deliver a variety of goods and services efficiently and consistently.
- Learning: The learning function of an operating model is essential to driving continuous improvement, increasing operating performance over time, and developing new products and services.
- As firms seek to deliver value and optimize scale, scope, and learning, their operating models should match the direction set by their business models.
- Alignment between a company’s business model and operating model At the same time, however, an expansion in each of the three operational dimensions increases the complexity of traditional operating models and makes managing them ever more challenging. This, critically, creates the operational constraints that have traditionally limited the value created and captured by firms. This is exactly where the digital firm differs. By deploying a fundamentally new kind of operating model, this new type of firm is reaching new levels of scalability, achieving a vastly broader scope, and learning and adapting at a much faster rate than does a traditional firm. This is because the digital firm is transforming the critical path in the delivery of value.
- the essence of the digital operating model is avoiding direct human intervention on the critical path of the product- or service-delivery process.
- The firm anchors these processes in a central repository of data, describing customer and operational needs in an integrated fashion. As the customer interacts with the business process, software modules gather the necessary data, extract and analyze needs, internalize their implications, and interact with the customer to deliver the value as promised. Building customer interaction processes on a centralized data architecture thus operationalizes and automates the idea of customer centricity in a clear, actionable, and scalable way.
- Removing human and organizational bottlenecks from the critical path has a huge impact on the nature of the company’s operating model. The marginal cost of serving an additional user on many digital networks is, for all purposes, zero, apart from the small incremental cost of computing capacity, which is easily available from cloud service providers. This inherently makes a digital operating model easier to scale. Growth constraints are much less dependent on human actors, and organizational constraints are rarely a problem, because much of the operational complexity is solved through software and analytics or outsourced to external partners in the operating network.
- A digital operating model also fundamentally changes the architecture of the firm. Beyond removing human bottlenecks, digital technologies are intrinsically modular and can easily enable business connections. When fully digitized, a process can easily be plugged in to an external network of partners and providers, or even into external communities of individuals, to provide additional, complementary value. Digitized processes are thus intrinsically multisided. After value is delivered in one domain (e.g., accumulating data about a set of consumers), that same process can be connected to drive value in other applications, thereby increasing firm scope and adding a multiplicative factor to the value it’s delivering to the customer.
- Finally, digitizing the operating model can also enable much faster learning and innovation. The vast amounts of accumulated data provide critical input to an increasingly broad range of tasks, from instant app personalization to feature innovation and product development. In addition, by digitizing many of the operational workflows, this model diminishes the overall size of the organization along with the surrounding bureaucracy. The insights provided by analyzing a rich foundation of data can thus be rapidly deployed into actions by a relatively small number of agile product teams.
- Ultimately, in a digital operating model, the employees do not deliver the product or service; instead, they design and oversee a software-automated, algorithm-driven digital “organization” that actually delivers the goods. This completely changes the factors involved in management, transforms the growth process, and removes traditional operating bottlenecks constraining scale, scope, and learning in a firm.
