- The most important value creation dynamic of a digital operating model is its network effects. The basic definition of a network effect is that the underlying value or utility of a product or service increases as the number of users utilizing the service increases.
- Precisely how much the value increases as a function of the number of users (often referred to as N) is dependent on context and is subject to much debate. For example, Metcalfe’s law for communication posits that the value of a network is the square of the number of users, N2. Others have noted that not all nodes in a network are equally valuable and that the value increase may be less steep and be modeled as NLog(N). Still others simply state that the value of a network may be a linear function of N. Regardless of the shape of the value curve, the main element to take away is that a network’s intrinsic utility increases as it adds users.
- Generally speaking, the more network connections, the greater the value; that’s the basic mechanism generating the network effect. The most basic underlying operating model of a platform hosting a network is to enable a match between users, and thus capture the value generated by network effects.
- There are two main types of network effects: direct and indirect. Fax machines, messaging applications, and social networks exhibit direct network effects, meaning that the users value the presence of other users.
- Indirect network effects exist when users in one category—say, sellers—value the presence of users in some other category—say, buyers—on a network.
- For a business to exhibit strong network effects, the value delivered must continue to increase sharply as the size of the network expands. As a rule, businesses that rely on weak network effects are characterized by many competitors, whereas those that engender strong network effects have fewer competitors and increased market concentration and therefore can claim a more substantial competitive advantage.
