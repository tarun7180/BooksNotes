- Now, the age of AI is manifested by companies driving another fundamental transformation. This one involves industrializing data gathering, analytics, and decision making to reinvent the core of the modern firm, in what we call the “AI factory.”
- The AI factory is the scalable decision engine that powers the digital operating model of the twenty-first-century firm. Managerial decisions are increasingly embedded in software, which digitizes many processes that have traditionally been carried out by employees.
- Analytics systematically convert internal and external data into predictions, insights, and choices, which in turn guide or even automate a variety of operational actions. This is what enables the superior scale, scope, and learning capacity of the digital firm.
- AI factories are at the core of the model, guiding the most critical processes and operating decisions, while humans are moved to the edge, off the critical path of value delivery.
- If the data is the fuel that powers the AI factory, then infrastructure makes up the pipes that deliver the fuel, and the algorithms are the machines that do the work. The experimentation platform, in turn, controls the valves that connect new fuel, pipes, and machines to existing operational systems.
- Unsupervised learning is useful for gaining insights from social media postings by, say, identifying customer groups and sentiment patterns that can be used to guide product development. Attitudinal and demographic survey responses by customers can be used to create customer segments. The reasons for customer churn could also be categorized through unsupervised learning. In manufacturing settings, one could group instances of machine failure or order delay.
- To be reliably impactful, the wealth of predictions generated by data and algorithms in an AI factory requires careful validation.
- The experimentation platform is a necessary component of the AI factory.
- The data pipeline, the algorithm design and execution engine, and the experimentation platform should all be embedded in software infrastructure to drive the operating activities of the digital firm.
- Concurrent with investments in data and software are strategic investments in connectivity and infrastructure to integrate with the data platform.
- Building a consistent (and secure!) data platform is even more important if the data is exposed to external partners.
- building a state-of-the-art AI factory with a well-designed data platform improves the organization’s ability to focus on the crucial challenges of data governance and security. The massive amount of data that is increasingly captured from users, suppliers, partners, and employees is extremely valuable, sensitive, and private. It simply should not be stored in an ad hoc fashion. An organization needs to build a secure, centralized system for careful data security and governance, defining appropriate checks and balances on access and usage, inventorying the assets carefully, and providing all stakeholders with the necessary protection.
- As part of the essential data governance challenge, carefully defining clear and secure APIs is essential to the AI factory. After all, APIs throttle the flow of data in and out of AI factory systems. Think of it as a way for the company to control all the data and functionality that it is willing to offer to internal and to external developers. As such, APIs control access to some of the most critical and private assets within the organization. They force the company to define, ahead of time, which of these critical assets it wants to make available within the enterprise and which it may be willing to offer to anyone outside the company. The data that can flow through an API can make or break a digital company.
- Ultimately, the data, software, and connectivity underlying an AI factory must reside within a secure, robust, and scalable computational infrastructure. Increasingly this infrastructure is on the cloud, is scalable on demand, and is built using standard off-the-shelf components and open source software.
- In addition, it needs to be seamlessly connected to the many individual processes and activities that constitute the company’s operating model.
