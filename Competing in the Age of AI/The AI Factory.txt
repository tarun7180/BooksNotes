- Now, the age of AI is manifested by companies driving another fundamental transformation. This one involves industrializing data gathering, analytics, and decision making to reinvent the core of the modern firm, in what we call the “AI factory.”
- The AI factory is the scalable decision engine that powers the digital operating model of the twenty-first-century firm. Managerial decisions are increasingly embedded in software, which digitizes many processes that have traditionally been carried out by employees.
- Analytics systematically convert internal and external data into predictions, insights, and choices, which in turn guide or even automate a variety of operational actions. This is what enables the superior scale, scope, and learning capacity of the digital firm.
- AI factories are at the core of the model, guiding the most critical processes and operating decisions, while humans are moved to the edge, off the critical path of value delivery.
- If the data is the fuel that powers the AI factory, then infrastructure makes up the pipes that deliver the fuel, and the algorithms are the machines that do the work. The experimentation platform, in turn, controls the valves that connect new fuel, pipes, and machines to existing operational systems.
- Unsupervised learning is useful for gaining insights from social media postings by, say, identifying customer groups and sentiment patterns that can be used to guide product development. Attitudinal and demographic survey responses by customers can be used to create customer segments. The reasons for customer churn could also be categorized through unsupervised learning. In manufacturing settings, one could group instances of machine failure or order delay.
- To be reliably impactful, the wealth of predictions generated by data and algorithms in an AI factory requires careful validation.
- The experimentation platform is a necessary component of the AI factory.
