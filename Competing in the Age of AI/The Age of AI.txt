- AI is becoming a force in the arts, connecting various disciplines and media and expanding the range of artistic possibilities.
- But AMI and other similar programs are taking AI even further into the realm of creation: in addition to replicating existing styles, AI is being used to create completely new works of art.3 This endeavor transforms not only the method for crafting the work of art but also the organization and process that conceives and creates it. Ahmed Elgammal, director of the Art & Artificial Intelligence Lab at Rutgers University, is working with an art-generating algorithm called AICAN that is programmed to produce novelty without substantial help from human artists. The program starts with training data drawn from a vast assemblage of paintings dating from the fourteenth century and produces something fundamentally different: paintings “inspired” by established artistic styles but entirely new. Thus, the AI algorithms do not merely expand the range of creation and distribution methods for artists; they also model the course of art history, offering insight into art’s long progression from figuration to abstraction and helping us understand processes that have been running in the collective unconscious for more than half a millennium.
- If a computer, aided by a few computer scientists and some fairly basic AI, can simulate, collaborate with, or possibly even extend the work of creative genius, we can almost guarantee that no field of human endeavor will remain independent of artificial intelligence. In discipline after discipline and industry after industry, digital networks and AI are becoming pervasive, defining a new age for business and for all of us.
- AI is becoming the universal engine of execution. As digital technology increasingly shapes “all of what we do” and enables a rapidly growing number of tasks and processes, AI is becoming the new operational foundation of business—the core of a company’s operating model, defining how the company drives the execution of tasks. AI is not only displacing human activity, it is changing the very concept of the firm.
- When a business is driven by AI, software instructions and algorithms make up the critical path in the way the firm delivers value. This is the “runtime”—the environment that shapes the execution of all processes
- Having software shape the critical path of operational execution has substantial ramifications. Digital, AI-driven processes are more scalable than traditional processes. They enable greater scope (or variety), as they easily connect with a myriad of other digitized businesses, and they create powerful opportunities for learning and improvement, such as the ability to produce ever more accurate, complex, and sophisticated predictions and even gain fundamental understanding. In doing so, networks and AI are reshaping the operational foundations of firms, enabling digital scale, scope, and learning, and erasing deep-seated limits that have constrained firm growth and impact for hundreds of years.
- Digital networks can alter and transform accepted approaches to social and political interaction, from dating to voting.
- We have entered a new age that is redefining how every organization (and virtually any worker) in the economy needs to act to create, capture, and deliver value. Whether we like it or not, digital networks and AI are transforming business, and society.
- The emergence of digital operating models is framing a mandate for leaders, in both new and old firms. We need to better understand how to manage, transform, grow, and control our businesses in an era of virtually unbounded potential impact.
- If you are leading a digital organization, you need to appreciate its full potential, along with both opportunities and challenges. If you are leading a traditional organization, you need to understand how to leverage your existing strengths in new ways and transform your operating capabilities to support the new strategies.
- AI presents new opportunities—for startups, established firms, entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs, for new economic, social, and political institutions, and yes, even for artists.
- AI-driven transformation not only prompts the creation of new companies but also motivates old companies to lead again, adopting the best of the new kind of operating model and appreciating the increased acceleration provided by a new, digital engine, without jettisoning traditional braking systems.
- Banking on past experiences and fueled by a new generation, some companies are taking the best of old and new to lead the way.
- a new breed of firm, characterized by digital scale, scope, and learning, is eclipsing traditional managerial methods and constraints, colliding with traditional firms and institutions, and transforming our economy. Software, analytics, and AI are reshaping the operational backbone of the firm.
- But we believe this transformation is about more than technology; it’s about the need to become a different kind of company.
- confronting this threat does not involve spinning off an online business, putting a laboratory in Silicon Valley, or creating a digital business unit. Rather, it involves a much deeper and more general challenge: rearchitecting how the firm works and changing the way it gathers and uses data, reacts to information, makes operating decisions, and executes operating tasks.
